1. General

1.1 Project Description

    Through algorithm fusion of multiple data sources from different sensors such as lidar, radar, camera, gps, imu and point cloud, iMorpheus.ai brings about an high availability precision GPS measurement to outdoor robotics developer. iMorpheus integrate a number of advanced algorithm such as slam, kalman filter, ICP, feature selection and Gaussian Process.

    We believe precise GPS signal should obtained by computing from cloud rather than measure the satellite, and soly software and cloud can solve the problem rather than expensive hardware. So that we committed into only software to solve the problem.

2. Function requests 

    2.1 Interfaces to External Systems

        We are now designning an API in ROS to external systems, which can give you calibrated GPS coordinates and GPS confidence levels we have calculated.

    2.2 Installation

        Two versions are needed, basic and professional version. The basic version can make you build up iMorphesuAi software environment quickly.
    
        If you are an engineer, we recommend that you ues professional version.

    2.3 Preprocess of point cloud data

    2.4 Calibration of lidar, IMU and GPS

    2.5 SLAM methods in different scenes
